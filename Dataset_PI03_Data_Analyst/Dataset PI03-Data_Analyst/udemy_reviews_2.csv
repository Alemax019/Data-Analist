0,"Original review: Jan. 18, 2023I bought a course and few days later found the course is on sale. So I requested for a refund, explaining the sale price issue. So customer support will either refund me the full money or send me an email to confirm if I am ok with a price adjustment. Instead of doing that they considered my case as Partial Refund for their convenience and issued me partial refund. I emailed them that I am expecting a full refund and then their customer care started playing with words that my initial reason made her THOUGHT I am asking for a price adjustment hence a partial refund. Anyway, later she confirmed that she has initiated a full refund and would get the money in 5-10 business days. I waited 15 days and no money was refunded, for which I had to reach their customer support again and had to go through the whole thing one more time. This time she informed that the refund was issued but it was stuck on her side (maybe they were expecting that I will forget and when I get back to them after a certain period of time, they will deny me the refund). Finally, I got informed after 15 days that I have to wait more 5-10 business days in order to get the full money back. I am in doubt whether I will receive the money or not but surely it was a horrible experience. They have zero knowledge about customer support (A.K.A customer harassment) and what makes it worse is they try to push sale. I have never expected such experience from UDEMY, because I have purchased many course from them. No more UDEMY purchase from me and would suggest others to look for other places.

I got excellent support for getting some discount codes when prices were too high. My purchases were high and also refunds. Refunds were requested because the course did not meet my expectations. Udemy has an apparent and unambiguous refund policy where if you are not satisfied for any reason, a refund will be processed with no questions asked.My recent purchase from Udemy was below standard and an outdated course. I wonder why Udemy cannot vet the instructors for their content. They want to promote some of the offered courses with no quality in mind. My request for a refund has been flagged. Their support process is very cumbersome. I finally managed to speak on a chat with a rep who seemed to understand my predicament and has escalated the issue for a refund. The moral of the story: stay away from Udemy as there are other good places to get online courses.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Oct. 12, 2022",1
312,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: June 10, 2021",1
342,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

345,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

375,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

462,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

This seems pretty bad to me. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Oct. 28, 2021",5
492,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

495,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 13, 2021",5
522,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I am 15, and I started using Udemy because I wanted to learn Unity, (a game engine) and purchased 4 courses on the subject. The first one I started was the ultimate guide to unity. I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

555,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy. While showing the evidence of purchasing and accessing the course also they are not coming forward to resolve the issue.. It's completely Waste of money...

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

642,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

672,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded.

My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Dec. 4, 2019",5
702,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

They denied it although I had only gone 19% through, their own website says a ""Significant portion needs to be used."" 19% is not significant. Secondly, they promise 30 days, what a lie.

I don't want a credit. I want a refund not a credit. I want the money refunded into my bank account.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Dec. 5, 2019",5
732,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Funny thing is, During my discussion with Udemy customer care representative before I provide them transaction id, they said even though I have transaction id they can't help in providing access to my purchased courses. After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: July 7, 2021",5
1002,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Aug. 15, 2021",5
1032,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account.

Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

This seems pretty bad to me. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","Original review: Nov. 18, 2021",2

There are lot of alternatives like LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, pluralsight, Frontend Masters, YouTube education sites, 2U, DataCamp, DataPro and many of them.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Aug. 16, 2021",5
1062,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

1065,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

1095,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy. While showing the evidence of purchasing and accessing the course also they are not coming forward to resolve the issue.. It's completely Waste of money...

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

1182,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

1212,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded.

My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 27, 2021",5
1242,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 29, 2021",5
1272,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

1275,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

1305,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

1335,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

1369,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

1399,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

1429,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I paid about about 15 USD for these courses and both are excellent (IMHO). I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

1489,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

1519,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

When I actually want to buy a course, it's super expensive and I have to wait until they get a ""sale"" so I can get it at the normal price. And I bet some poor folks are going to buy the courses when they are enormously over-priced.

I paid about about 15 USD for these courses and both are excellent (IMHO). I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

1579,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

1609,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

1669,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

1759,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

The courses on Udemy look cool and seem like you will learn a lot but yes you do learn some things but no you won't be helped if you get stuck. I am currently stuck on my game development and have been asking the instructor through Facebook (best way to contact him. He does not go on Udemy to see questions) and it has been a week and he won't respond to me. I literally can not move ahead without help. When I wrote Udemy four days ago they still will not respond. The support is awful and the phone support is even worse, they are all so snobby and rude.","Original review: Oct. 26, 2019",2

But after one month, one of the instructor has noticed that I am getting lots of traffic and enrollments, he enrolled into my course and steal all the contents from course and updated his course using mine. Moreover he put negative reviews on my course to pulling me down. I really surprised that there are 6 people enrolled and within half hour they all unenrolled and put 1 star negative comments (FAKE). I have complained to Udemy with proofs however Udemy has not taken any action against him even not updates me. Several times I contact Udemy Safety Team but NO RESULT. My students has also report of Udemy Policy Violation with proofs however they didn't took any action. I don't know what I have to do now? Might be I have to remove my course from Udemy and place to other sites where rules & regulations are followed and treat everyone same. Horrible and stressful experience working with Udemy so far.

1789,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

They don't explain how anything is done, and everything is based on mindless following of the instructors lesson. They teach to the rote level of learning. They claim a course is for beginners, but then don't explain the basics. 1/3 of my way into a course and I have been taught no basics of coding. Their support for students consists of a few know-it-all teachers who make one sentence comments to your questions and rarely even address the question you had. They always phrase it in a way that makes it sound like it is your fault. Their app is horrible. Ironic for a company teaching people to make apps. I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

So customer support will either refund me the full money or send me an email to confirm if I am ok with a price adjustment. Instead of doing that they considered my case as Partial Refund for their convenience and issued me partial refund. I emailed them that I am expecting a full refund and then their customer care started playing with words that my initial reason made her THOUGHT I am asking for a price adjustment hence a partial refund. Anyway, later she confirmed that she has initiated a full refund and would get the money in 5-10 business days. I waited 15 days and no money was refunded, for which I had to reach their customer support again and had to go through the whole thing one more time. This time she informed that the refund was issued but it was stuck on her side (maybe they were expecting that I will forget and when I get back to them after a certain period of time, they will deny me the refund). Finally, I got informed after 15 days that I have to wait more 5-10 business days in order to get the full money back. I am in doubt whether I will receive the money or not but surely it was a horrible experience. They have zero knowledge about customer support (A.K.A customer harassment) and what makes it worse is they try to push sale. I have never expected such experience from UDEMY, because I have purchased many course from them. No more UDEMY purchase from me and would suggest others to look for other places.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money.

My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

1992,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Oct. 12, 2022",1
2022,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste.

This seems pretty bad to me. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","Original review: Oct. 28, 2021",5

There are lot of alternatives like LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, pluralsight, Frontend Masters, YouTube education sites, 2U, DataCamp, DataPro and many of them.

It was convoluted, terribly confusing and I was listening to lectures two and three times without understanding it.

I bought the course 30 days prior on sale but didn't begin the course until a week and a half ago. I had another course in my Udemy cart for $165 which I took out because I think their customer service and policy is ridiculous.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: June 10, 2021",1
2052,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am 15, and I started using Udemy because I wanted to learn Unity, (a game engine) and purchased 4 courses on the subject. The first one I started was the ultimate guide to unity. I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

2055,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

There is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE so you cannot request a refund. These courses are not usually updated often even if the ""updated on"" date is recent.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

This seems pretty bad to me. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

2082,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am 15, and I started using Udemy because I wanted to learn Unity, (a game engine) and purchased 4 courses on the subject. The first one I started was the ultimate guide to unity. I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

2085,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

There is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE so you cannot request a refund. These courses are not usually updated often even if the ""updated on"" date is recent. This means they could have updated only a tiny section of the entire course.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

2112,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy. While showing the evidence of purchasing and accessing the course also they are not coming forward to resolve the issue.. It's completely Waste of money...

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

2172,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I have not received access to my purchased courses. When I contact Udemy customer support, the said they have not received money but I can see that money was deducted from my phone wallet and I have transaction id. Funny thing is, During my discussion with Udemy customer care representative before I provide them transaction id, they said even though I have transaction id they can't help in providing access to my purchased courses. After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses. Even though you have a transaction id which clearly chows that payment was done to Udemy india as shown below. I request all who wants to purchase courses from Udemy, just think twice and it is up to you.

This seems pretty bad to me. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","Original review: Nov. 29, 2021",2

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Oct. 28, 2021",5
2202,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

2205,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 13, 2021",5
2232,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Resolution response: Nov. 17, 2021",5
2262,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

2265,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

2352,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

2382,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy. While showing the evidence of purchasing and accessing the course also they are not coming forward to resolve the issue.. It's completely Waste of money...

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

2419,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

I had originally bought the course with a credit card I no longer use or have, and that was the ONLY way they wanted to refund money. What about just another course? No, they would not do that. What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have. Sooooo- I bought a course with lifetime access and Udemy won’t honor that, nor will they find me a way to get my money back. Customer service is non-existent. Just know that if you spend your money with Udemy, you are taking a chance. I would suggest not spending a lot so if your course gets pulled, you won’t be out a lot of money.

I asked Udemy how many enrolled are actually paying customers versus free coupon users. They would not answer. ""That information is not available"". Udemy deliberately misrepresents how much revenue an instructor can potentially make by stating these false numbers under the course title.

I am currently stuck on my game development and have been asking the instructor through Facebook (best way to contact him.

Moreover he put negative reviews on my course to pulling me down. I really surprised that there are 6 people enrolled and within half hour they all unenrolled and put 1 star negative comments (FAKE). I have complained to Udemy with proofs however Udemy has not taken any action against him even not updates me. Several times I contact Udemy Safety Team but NO RESULT. My students has also report of Udemy Policy Violation with proofs however they didn't took any action. I don't know what I have to do now? Might be I have to remove my course from Udemy and place to other sites where rules & regulations are followed and treat everyone same. Horrible and stressful experience working with Udemy so far.

2509,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have. Sooooo- I bought a course with lifetime access and Udemy won’t honor that, nor will they find me a way to get my money back. Customer service is non-existent.

2599,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars.

I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have. Sooooo- I bought a course with lifetime access and Udemy won’t honor that, nor will they find me a way to get my money back. Customer service is non-existent.

2689,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have. Sooooo- I bought a course with lifetime access and Udemy won’t honor that, nor will they find me a way to get my money back. Customer service is non-existent.

2779,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create.

I know that some people have had bad experiences with Udemy courses and I think that maybe because Udemy doesn't seem to be very good at setting the standards for courses they offer. So some are good and some not so good.So I suggest that the best way to approach Udemy courses is two fold: 1. Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

I Received a certificate and a discount voucher after I inquired about the course so they charge me £5.99. A month later I chose another course learning hypnosis and past life regression. The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that.

I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I logged into my account, removed the credit cards, and as I was going to change my password I was kicked out of my profile. I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I contacted support to find out what happened and was informed that these reviews were removed because they were 'marked as spam'.I'm talking about REAL, GENUINE reviews that were very very good and shared experience of my course with other students. When asking if they could just be human and SEE for themselves that the review is legitimate, they said they can't and it depends fully on their bot and will take that into account for next time. Because of that, I missed some amazing reviews because these 'people' that work here are also 'bots'. Very disappointed that they would remove the good reviews and no one to speak with.

After 3-4 months of painstaking work and over 4.5 hours of video content I had a smile on my face as I pressed that ""Submit for review"" button. After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

2936,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company.

People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

But apparently Udemy had sort of a bug and the email wasn't sent. I tried several times and waited over 24 hours but nothing appeared in my inbox. Then obviously stupid idea came to my mind - I decided to synchronize my google account with Udemy since I used the same email for it. I thought that it will recover my access to all the courses. But output was opposite. All my courses deleted and the same thing happened to my purchase history. Now I am fighting Udemy support struggling to get this problem resolved, over a week passed but there is still no adequate response from them. I provided all the required information, as transaction id's, confirmation emails from Google and Udemy but still we are going around in a circle with no result. I regret that I have decided to use their service. Their support is very low level and they don't care about their clients.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

They have no phone contact, they don't correspond with people - they just want to collect money and you take your chances and send you emails to resolve issues like a robot (for all you know, it is a robot or a human imitation of one).Udemy could have been a great platform and could be one of the best but they have turned this into a complete ""quick and dirty"" customer acquisition without paying any attention whatsoever to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

3086,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I Received a certificate and a discount voucher after I inquired about the course so they charge me £5.99. A month later I chose another course learning hypnosis and past life regression. The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

They have no phone contact, they don't correspond with people - they just want to collect money and you take your chances and send you emails to resolve issues like a robot (for all you know, it is a robot or a human imitation of one).Udemy could have been a great platform and could be one of the best but they have turned this into a complete ""quick and dirty"" customer acquisition without paying any attention whatsoever to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

I logged into my account, removed the credit cards, and as I was going to change my password I was kicked out of my profile. I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

3176,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I contacted support to find out what happened and was informed that these reviews were removed because they were 'marked as spam'.I'm talking about REAL, GENUINE reviews that were very very good and shared experience of my course with other students. When asking if they could just be human and SEE for themselves that the review is legitimate, they said they can't and it depends fully on their bot and will take that into account for next time. Because of that, I missed some amazing reviews because these 'people' that work here are also 'bots'. Very disappointed that they would remove the good reviews and no one to speak with.

After 3-4 months of painstaking work and over 4.5 hours of video content I had a smile on my face as I pressed that ""Submit for review"" button. After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

3206,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company.

But output was opposite. All my courses deleted and the same thing happened to my purchase history. Now I am fighting Udemy support struggling to get this problem resolved, over a week passed but there is still no adequate response from them.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

But apparently Udemy had sort of a bug and the email wasn't sent. I tried several times and waited over 24 hours but nothing appeared in my inbox. Then obviously stupid idea came to my mind - I decided to synchronize my google account with Udemy since I used the same email for it. I thought that it will recover my access to all the courses. But output was opposite. All my courses deleted and the same thing happened to my purchase history. Now I am fighting Udemy support struggling to get this problem resolved, over a week passed but there is still no adequate response from them. I provided all the required information, as transaction id's, confirmation emails from Google and Udemy but still we are going around in a circle with no result. I regret that I have decided to use their service. Their support is very low level and they don't care about their clients.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

And I texted to get an answer and instead of answering the solution, when I finally got to the instructor, he simply deflected the question and demanded me to ask the question somewhere else.

I have not received access to my purchased courses. When I contact Udemy customer support, the said they have not received money but I can see that money was deducted from my phone wallet and I have transaction id. Funny thing is, During my discussion with Udemy customer care representative before I provide them transaction id, they said even though I have transaction id they can't help in providing access to my purchased courses. After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses. Even though you have a transaction id which clearly chows that payment was done to Udemy india as shown below. I request all who wants to purchase courses from Udemy, just think twice and it is up to you.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Dec. 30, 2022",1
3462,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","Original review: Sept. 25, 2022",1

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

3533,"Original review: March 21, 2020Never trust Udemy. It is the most pathetic, unworthy and untrustful site. Here are the reasons:1. I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

3582,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I have not received access to my purchased courses.

Funny thing is, During my discussion with Udemy customer care representative before I provide them transaction id, they said even though I have transaction id they can't help in providing access to my purchased courses. After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses. Even though you have a transaction id which clearly chows that payment was done to Udemy india as shown below.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: July 7, 2021",5
3612,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Aug. 15, 2021",5
3642,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Aug. 16, 2021",5
3672,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am 15, and I started using Udemy because I wanted to learn Unity, (a game engine) and purchased 4 courses on the subject. The first one I started was the ultimate guide to unity. I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

3675,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Oct. 17, 2021",5

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

I was preparing for Google Cloud certification and I purchased 3 courses from Udemy. All the 3 courses were removed one week before my certification exam. The refund does not happen automatically. We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

But suddenly the course has been disappeared from my account. When approaching customer services for the issue just they replied that, ""We will update you via mail"", and closing the chat. But the fact is that, they don't know how long will it take to resolve the issue. Peak of the story is that, they even don't have recorded data of purchase of the course in udemy.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well.

There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

After 48 hours, they mentioned that they have not received money and hence they cannot provide access to my purchased courses.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Resolution response: Nov. 17, 2021",5
3792,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 18, 2021",5
3822,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste.

Udemy offered many courses, some as low as $12.99, which made it easy on the wallet. I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales. Udemy saved my sanity this year at a very reasonable cost, and taught me quite a bit during the process. Two thumbs up!","Original review: Nov. 27, 2021",5
3852,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

I am only about halfway into it, and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful! I cannot say anything about the other courses I purchased, but I believe they will be the same.The one issue I had was with purchasing the courses... when I tried to purchase a course, it would tell me there was an error and that I should try again. However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible. Very soon, a Udemy employee sent me a message saying she had looked into the problem and tried to help me. I was very pleased with the quick response and the helpfulness of the email.

3855,"Original review: Feb. 21, 2021Hi Friends, I'm sharing my very worst experience with Udemy Trust & Safety as well Copyrights Team... I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","Original review: Jan. 14, 2020",2

I've taken a number of courses in orchestration, composition, MIDI programming, etc. and while I like some more than others (personal preference as to teaching styles), *all* of them were informative, well presented and the lecturers clearly understood their subject matter. The great thing about Udemy, is, if there's a course that is more costly (i.e. $99), just wait and chances are it will be $12-20 before long. They are constantly having sales.

3882,"Original review: April 22, 2021The company has a rudimentary algorithm from what I researched that appears to favor people that are earning them more money, the issue with this is the older teachers who were around longer appear to get much more attention than an instructor that is more educated or more qualified and brand new, from what I can see any new instructor on the platform does not have a shot in hell of growing because of their limited growth since they no longer appear to heavily market and instead have the nerve to ask the creators to market. If their favorite creator reports a competitor Udemy will automatically side with the favorite creator who is filling their greedy pockets. Furthermore, the classes I have taken are made by young students that have no certifications nor degrees to back their teaching.For example Simon ** claims to be an expert in real estate investing however he is teaching people to illegally break landlord leases and sublease units in buildings and offer short term rentals, yet I was just fined $4000 dollars by my city for doing what Simon ** taught me to do and the judge claimed it was illegal, I reported this to Udemy and they still have his videos up because so many people are buying it and in the end Udemy is illegally teaching people how to invest in real estate, right now I am looking into a lawyer to see if I can sue Udemy and Simon ** for fraud and misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud a student.

However, I contacted Udemy about this and got two automated replies saying my question had been received, and that they would reply to me as soon as possible.

I wanted to do preparation for RPA courses and enrolled to 3 Instructors courses. One of the Instructor (A) courses are very famous and most reliable which recommended by my friend. Other instructor (B) was newbie however I enrolled to his course based on reviews (Fake/Paid) on the course. When I finished 1st instructor (A) course (completed practicing all questions in mock tests) I started to practice question on other instructor course and I truly shocked b'coz same questions, contents I found which I already practiced on 1st Instructor course (A). Means this guy has copied Instructor (A) entire course including questions, images, explanation as well descriptions too.I rated one star with the honest feedback (This guy has copied ....bla bla) and got refund as well report his course to Udemy Trust and Safety for Udemy copyright policy violation. I thought Udemy will banned this guy and removed his course but regret No any Action taken by Udemy against his course even my review also not displayed on his course landing page. (Might be some of the Udemy people getting undertable money from this types of guys).So I understand that there is no any meaning of Copyrights for Udemy as well no any meaning of instructor course privacy too. Anyone can create exam preparation courses by copying others contents and make money. Udemy Trust & Safely, Copyrights and Instructor Support teams are a big joke and damn jack** too. So, if you are planning to create course on Udemy, please think thousands time prior to publish. Udemy is a untrustworthy, unreliable and most cheater company who only works for their money. Money is everything for them NOT any Instructor or his/her privacy.

We need to raise a request. The site is too bad and too confusing. So, we cannot rely on Udemy at all. The courses on Udemy are pathetically arranged and recorded. Prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they provide a good quality courses.2. Udemy cannot be trusted as your data is posted on other sites. My comments for a course could be seen on https://courses.javacodegeeks.com/ site of which I don't have account. When I contacted Udemy to remove the message, they mislead the students by saying that contact the instructor. When I contact the instructor the instructor says that ""This is really strange and am not sure why and how it's happening. It had happened before as well. Seems these sites like javacodegeeks.com are being paid by udemy to promote these courses because when I click on enroll course on that page, it redirects it to Udemy.""3. There is no guarantee that Udemy will not sell your bank account to hackers if they can post your comments to other sites for publicity and misled the students.In short, never use Udemy account. They are unreliable and their customer care sucks. Even if the course is offer free, don't register on Udemy. Most of the courses are time waste. Better prefer Coursera, LinuxAcademy or CloudAcademy as they are much safe and protect your privacy in terms of your comments, login details and account details.

Don't buy any class that doesn't have at least 500 reviews and an average review score greater than 4.0 (out of 5). (It also helps to read some of the reviews as well.) 2. Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have.

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

3979,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

Their support for students consists of a few know-it-all teachers who make one sentence comments to your questions and rarely even address the question you had. They always phrase it in a way that makes it sound like it is your fault. Their app is horrible. Ironic for a company teaching people to make apps. I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have.

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

4069,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

Their support for students consists of a few know-it-all teachers who make one sentence comments to your questions and rarely even address the question you had. They always phrase it in a way that makes it sound like it is your fault. Their app is horrible. Ironic for a company teaching people to make apps. I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have.

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

4159,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

Their support for students consists of a few know-it-all teachers who make one sentence comments to your questions and rarely even address the question you had. They always phrase it in a way that makes it sound like it is your fault. Their app is horrible. Ironic for a company teaching people to make apps. I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have.

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

4249,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

Their support for students consists of a few know-it-all teachers who make one sentence comments to your questions and rarely even address the question you had. They always phrase it in a way that makes it sound like it is your fault. Their app is horrible. Ironic for a company teaching people to make apps. I tried to download the videos and use them offline, but it kept crashing. They are fraudulent in their claim of review stars. When you start the course, the review is set at 5 stars automatically. If you do nothing, they still get 5 stars. You have to change it or they get 5 stars. If someone gets frustrated and leaves without changing, they get 5 stars. Completely unethical way to handle reviews.

I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have.

Never pay more than 20 USD for a course. If you adhere to these guidelines, I don't see how you can go wrong. Where else are you going to get a good to great course for less than the price of a book?

By far the worst course I have used is the C++ for absolute beginners. This is a total load of crap. The instruction is rushed. The education is extremely light and incomplete except for a general sprinkling of what is in the lesson plan of the moment, and the instructor is just barely there for you. This particular course is NOT for beginners and the line that it is, is an outright lie. That should give you some food for thought of the vetting process that they go through over there.

I had originally bought the course with a credit card I no longer use or have, and that was the ONLY way they wanted to refund money. What about just another course? No, they would not do that. What about refund to PayPal, Visa gift card, or old school check? No! They kept telling me to contact my financial institution. I can’t do that, I told them. I no longer have that info. Response- We can’t give you credit or a check- we can’t afford to do that for the number of students we have. Sooooo- I bought a course with lifetime access and Udemy won’t honor that, nor will they find me a way to get my money back. Customer service is non-existent.

4339,"Original review: April 16, 2019I just tried to a course from Udemy. I'm gonna break this down into two parts, one for Udemy itself, and the second for the course.1) Udemy. I have just realized that Udemy itself is simply just a sharing/money channeling platform for online courses. There is obviously no quality control of the courses which get put up and evidently (having tried one course), it seems that anyone can create a course and upload it for resale. It's basically the same model for the different app store platforms just as Google Play, etc. This means that you cannot be sure of the quality of the course you are purchasing.2) Courses. I tried one course, Microsoft SQL server 2019 by Taurius Litvinavicius. It was terrible. When the presenter talked through the setup options for installing SQL Server, he was basically just making it up as he went along, often just reading the descriptions of the each option with no proper explanation of what they were, and often choosing which options to keep/remove based on how much disk space they used because 'we might need that.' But again, without saying what it might be needed for. Later on, in a chapter about Security, the information was downright wrong. Finally, the English was overly casual, often bad, and the subtitles appeared to be machine generated and were massively inaccurate compounding on already bad English.Note: I already have some hands-on experience with SQL Server and wanted to formalize and confirm my knowledge by taking a course. And I bought this course based on the assumption that someone who had written a course would naturally have better knowledge than me and would be able to fill in some gaps. NOT SO. It was evident that this 'instructor' had no formal training in SQL Server at all. It was also clear that he had not properly prepared this course, evident from the pauses and vagueness in talking through the install options as he obviously wasn't sure himself.Summary. Based on this one experience, I will not be buying any more courses on Udemy. It is not the professional course-specialist entity that I thought it was, and in fact is far from it. Equally important is the fact that courses are being created by people who are obviously not professionals on the subject matter of the course(s) they create. These are amateurs leading amateurs, complete with inaccuracies and mistakes and disinformation, and ultimately wasting your precious time and money.

After 3-4 months of painstaking work and over 4.5 hours of video content I had a smile on my face as I pressed that ""Submit for review"" button. After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

4376,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I Received a certificate and a discount voucher after I inquired about the course so they charge me £5.99. A month later I chose another course learning hypnosis and past life regression. The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

They have no phone contact, they don't correspond with people - they just want to collect money and you take your chances and send you emails to resolve issues like a robot (for all you know, it is a robot or a human imitation of one).Udemy could have been a great platform and could be one of the best but they have turned this into a complete ""quick and dirty"" customer acquisition without paying any attention whatsoever to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

I logged into my account, removed the credit cards, and as I was going to change my password I was kicked out of my profile. I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

4466,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I contacted support to find out what happened and was informed that these reviews were removed because they were 'marked as spam'.I'm talking about REAL, GENUINE reviews that were very very good and shared experience of my course with other students. When asking if they could just be human and SEE for themselves that the review is legitimate, they said they can't and it depends fully on their bot and will take that into account for next time. Because of that, I missed some amazing reviews because these 'people' that work here are also 'bots'. Very disappointed that they would remove the good reviews and no one to speak with.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

4496,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course.

But output was opposite. All my courses deleted and the same thing happened to my purchase history. Now I am fighting Udemy support struggling to get this problem resolved, over a week passed but there is still no adequate response from them. I provided all the required information, as transaction id's, confirmation emails from Google and Udemy but still we are going around in a circle with no result.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

I Received a certificate and a discount voucher after I inquired about the course so they charge me £5.99. A month later I chose another course learning hypnosis and past life regression. The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

They have no phone contact, they don't correspond with people - they just want to collect money and you take your chances and send you emails to resolve issues like a robot (for all you know, it is a robot or a human imitation of one).Udemy could have been a great platform and could be one of the best but they have turned this into a complete ""quick and dirty"" customer acquisition without paying any attention whatsoever to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

After 3-4 months of painstaking work and over 4.5 hours of video content I had a smile on my face as I pressed that ""Submit for review"" button. After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

4646,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company.

People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

But apparently Udemy had sort of a bug and the email wasn't sent. I tried several times and waited over 24 hours but nothing appeared in my inbox. Then obviously stupid idea came to my mind - I decided to synchronize my google account with Udemy since I used the same email for it. I thought that it will recover my access to all the courses. But output was opposite. All my courses deleted and the same thing happened to my purchase history. Now I am fighting Udemy support struggling to get this problem resolved, over a week passed but there is still no adequate response from them. I provided all the required information, as transaction id's, confirmation emails from Google and Udemy but still we are going around in a circle with no result. I regret that I have decided to use their service. Their support is very low level and they don't care about their clients.

I Received a certificate and a discount voucher after I inquired about the course so they charge me £5.99. A month later I chose another course learning hypnosis and past life regression. The course was good in itself and again another certificate but no certificate was issued and an error so had to email support and when they sent the certificate it was not the same as the one in the download. This course cost me £9.99 and after you completed it you would receive a discount code for 75% off the next course. But when you choose the next course from the same lady doing the past life hypnosis the course price had gone up to £29.99 so you would still have to pay the same. Then a couple of weeks later I logged back in to udemy.com Only to find that every course price had sky rocketed up to £59.99. I initially thought I was seeing things but my partner verified the price of nearly £60 pound was true. I even took screen shots on my tablet to contact the company to ask why they are being greedy. I went onto Google Play and downloaded their application and all their courses were £9.99 but when I logged in they were £59.99. I log back out and the price goes down. I left them some feedback on Google explaining this and they never replied to my feedback left for them on the Play Store.People need to be very careful that they don't get sucked in by this rip off company. It clearly proves that they're out to try and con the people who buy their courses. There's no way of getting In Touch with the people who run this website. They don't care about their consumers but one thing I do know for sure is THEY'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. People need to be very careful when purchasing courses and double check the price because if Udemy think for one second you're going to pay they're going to hike up their prices hoping you click the buy now because once you press that pay now they take control of your funds in your bank and you won't get it back. I nearly fell prey to their con. Luckily I noticed the price increase and got a second opinion and had to let people know what Udemy had done so it doesn't happen to them.

I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself.

They have no phone contact, they don't correspond with people - they just want to collect money and you take your chances and send you emails to resolve issues like a robot (for all you know, it is a robot or a human imitation of one).Udemy could have been a great platform and could be one of the best but they have turned this into a complete ""quick and dirty"" customer acquisition without paying any attention whatsoever to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had so many billing issues, refund issues, platform issues and on and on and there is not enough space to write all my grievances but lest be assured that at the current rate, this business won't survive and you are better off paying some other provider because I haven't seen any improvement since I have signed up on this more than a few years ago. Sadly, it has only deteriorated. Even if it costs a bit more, you are better off with another provider as I have lost hope in Udemy.

I received an email stating that my email address was changed, not to validate the change but that it was changed. Nice. So in the interim I called my credit card companies, made fraud claims with them regarding the charges, went back and opened support incidents with Udemy. This morning I received an email asking for a screenshot of the notice of email change and they also wanted ""the last four of the credit cards, how my name appears, and the expiry date. ""Who the hell asks for an expiry date, a bit unprofessional."" I respond with the screenshot but I refuse to divulge the other information. The amount was also in excess of $1300 that was charged. I have not heard anything back from Udemy. Also there is no phone number to call, what the hell is going on here, can't find any public information about this company, nothing. Also with most online retailers that you have a credit card saved with their website, on purchases they will ask you to verify the 3 or four number code associated with the card, guess Udemy doesn't do that. I have not heard any thing back from them since my first reply to their request. Next stop the BBB.

I had a direct access with immediate possibility to start any courses. The free ones are not so good and were for me unuseful... I bought it to trust my own knowledges... one of the non-native English trainer is awful... but the course was for free.... so whatever!I just finished one course I bought and I am completely happy with that! The trainer was clear, I had a lot of documents to download in order to complete the course. Some documents sum up info, some others are extra information. So TOP! I am happy with the quite quick interraction with the other students and trainers. UDEMY is the 3rd ""Academy"" for online courses I connect. And I like it! Of course the certification you obtain at the end is not an recocgnized certification, but the courses I bought are anyway not knowledge that are certified. If I subscribe for the same in another school saying ""Certification"" it is anyway not recognized and I will pay a huge more amount of money. So for me, UDEMY is OK. I am used to learn by myself. I am excited to continue with the other courses I bought.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity.

I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing.

The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I contacted support to find out what happened and was informed that these reviews were removed because they were 'marked as spam'.I'm talking about REAL, GENUINE reviews that were very very good and shared experience of my course with other students. When asking if they could just be human and SEE for themselves that the review is legitimate, they said they can't and it depends fully on their bot and will take that into account for next time. Because of that, I missed some amazing reviews because these 'people' that work here are also 'bots'. Very disappointed that they would remove the good reviews and no one to speak with.

After 3-4 months of painstaking work and over 4.5 hours of video content I had a smile on my face as I pressed that ""Submit for review"" button. After clicking that button it asked me to verify my address so I put my address and it used this third party verification service and I was then told they failed to verify my identity. So obviously this third party service does not have a record of me on file. I am very cautious who I give my information to so it makes sense why this third party company would not be aware of me.Anyway now I Have been given until 6th of April to prove I own the rights to my own course and verify my identity. I am very annoyed that Udemy would rely on this unreliable source and assume they would know where I live. If I fail to verify my identity by 6th of April my account is closed and course content deleted. I am very worried that all my content will be deleted and I just hope that the verification process is successful. All this work may have been for nothing. Shame on Udemy for not telling me about this ** process at the start.

4796,"Original review: March 29, 2018Udemy is a classic example of corporate greed. I have taken courses and produced one. So I have seen the platform from different perspectives. The initial intention of the platform has been lost in a sea of greed. Numbers are their only concern, as Udemy only cares about data and money. They offer outrageous discounts which devalue the course value. They allow people to give a review of a course after 10 minutes of content. They have made instructors so stressed about reviews and registrations, that there is no point in focusing on quality content and developing the learning experience. Unfortunately, the learners are not getting the best material because there is no real incentive to put together quality content. So everybody loses because Udemy just wants a bunch of students enrolled and data. The platform was probably meaningful when it began. But scaling up and expanding became the priority, so now it is no longer a fun learning environment.

I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed.

It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

I would recommend Udemy provide a 30-second example of the teacher so you don't get stuck with professor Mumbles.

4847,"Original review: Aug. 24, 2015I learned of Udemy through a third party website that was selling a group of Udemy lectures in a package of courses for a relatively reasonable price. I really wanted to learn how to code in python, so I made the purchase based on the description and the excellent reviews the lecture had on Udemy's website. I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed. It's clear the course description was fabricated by the lecturers and that the reviews were fabricated as well. I went to see how Udemy screens its lecturers. It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

This just reruns with the clock count down, all of the time. It is designed to make you buy courses. The second is that some instructors will answer question and some just never do. A case in point is an instructor Melanie who runs a course How To Sell Your Art Online With Etsy. After several attempts, I contacted Udemy who had this to say, ""Unfortunately, every once in a while, an instructor will publish a course but not return to the course often, or immediately respond to messages from students. While we encourage instructors to stay engaged with their students, ultimately, we don't have control over responsiveness.""Udemy is a neutral marketplace for instructors and students, which means that instructors are responsible for the content they provide. That is just not good enough. I recommend you try to check the reviews on Udemy before you purchase any course. I paid with PayPal and will take a refund. It is not the money but the rudeness and ""don't give a hand, we have your money"" attitude that infuriates me.

4871,"Original review: Aug. 24, 2015I learned of Udemy through a third party website that was selling a group of Udemy lectures in a package of courses for a relatively reasonable price. I really wanted to learn how to code in python, so I made the purchase based on the description and the excellent reviews the lecture had on Udemy's website. I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed. It's clear the course description was fabricated by the lecturers and that the reviews were fabricated as well. I went to see how Udemy screens its lecturers. It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

They had enough qualifications and personal experiences and the courses were designed keeping students ease and comfort on mind. It was great learning with Udemy instructors.

Most of them were readily available to answer student questions whenever required by students. I am very highly satisfied with most courses and instructors .

4919,"Original review: Aug. 24, 2015I learned of Udemy through a third party website that was selling a group of Udemy lectures in a package of courses for a relatively reasonable price. I really wanted to learn how to code in python, so I made the purchase based on the description and the excellent reviews the lecture had on Udemy's website. I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed. It's clear the course description was fabricated by the lecturers and that the reviews were fabricated as well. I went to see how Udemy screens its lecturers. It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

I feel bullied and confused like I'd just experienced a traumatic mugging. If you're a new instructor, I'd avoid Udemy and consider one of many alternative companies.

4967,"Original review: Aug. 24, 2015I learned of Udemy through a third party website that was selling a group of Udemy lectures in a package of courses for a relatively reasonable price. I really wanted to learn how to code in python, so I made the purchase based on the description and the excellent reviews the lecture had on Udemy's website. I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed. It's clear the course description was fabricated by the lecturers and that the reviews were fabricated as well. I went to see how Udemy screens its lecturers. It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

4970,"Original review: Dec. 23, 2017I have completed 4 courses on Udemy. I have two concerns, one, is the false advertising saying courses are on special for set period of time: this is not true. This just reruns with the clock count down, all of the time. It is designed to make you buy courses. The second is that some instructors will answer question and some just never do. A case in point is an instructor Melanie who runs a course How To Sell Your Art Online With Etsy. After several attempts, I contacted Udemy who had this to say, ""Unfortunately, every once in a while, an instructor will publish a course but not return to the course often, or immediately respond to messages from students. While we encourage instructors to stay engaged with their students, ultimately, we don't have control over responsiveness.""Udemy is a neutral marketplace for instructors and students, which means that instructors are responsible for the content they provide. That is just not good enough. I recommend you try to check the reviews on Udemy before you purchase any course. I paid with PayPal and will take a refund. It is not the money but the rudeness and ""don't give a hand, we have your money"" attitude that infuriates me.

4991,"Original review: Aug. 24, 2015I learned of Udemy through a third party website that was selling a group of Udemy lectures in a package of courses for a relatively reasonable price. I really wanted to learn how to code in python, so I made the purchase based on the description and the excellent reviews the lecture had on Udemy's website. I started to take the course and found the course to be riddled with errors and incredibly poorly designed. It's clear the course description was fabricated by the lecturers and that the reviews were fabricated as well. I went to see how Udemy screens its lecturers. It appears that they allow almost anyone who has the time to create a lecture series and post it on their website - it doesn't seem as if they screen the lecturers or the reviews, but I may be wrong here. They might screen, but do a poor job of it. Anywho, I attempted to get a refund based on their 30 day money back guarantee, but Udemy refused. They apparently will not honor the 30 day money back guarantee if their product was sold through a 3rd party. This concept doesn't make sense to me. It's Udemy that chose to sell the product and it's Udemy that chose to allow the content of said product to be incredibly poor. Why should anyone but the website that allows lecturers to lie on their descriptions and reviews be held accountable. Currently neither website will refund me and I just feel really scammed. I trusted reviews and a description on a website, when I was wrong to trust either. I've learned my lesson, so I've decided to share it. If you're going to use Udemy, don't purchase from a 3rd party or find another website that will stand behind their product regardless of the circumstances.

4992,"Original review: Feb. 18, 2018I purchased a course at Udemy.com for a very inexpensive price. I didn't stop to check where the company was based before I gave them my debit card information. I was overcharged substantially!! I looked to see that Udemy was founded in Turkey (I'm in the USA) and nearly panicked that I had given my bank info to them. I contacted them through instant chat and they immediately apologized, took responsibility and immediately issued a refund that showed in my Chase account within 24 hours. (Better than some American companies...) Anyways, I'm now using my course that I am really enjoying. It is very professional and well done by the teacher (Rich **). He is gifted and patient - able to teach. I felt so relieved I wanted to write them a review letting people know they seem to be a trustworthy business. Thanks for great customer service Udemy.","Original review: Jan. 6, 2017",1
4993,"Original review: Feb. 17, 2018This course is WONDERFUL! Just what I needed. I do have one issue, however. I am having a great deal of difficulty understanding the instructor. His accent to me makes it difficult to comprehend all the terms. I'm getting used to it now but I could use it a bit clearer.","Original review: Sept. 11, 2016",4
4994,"Original review: Dec. 23, 2017I have completed 4 courses on Udemy. I have two concerns, one, is the false advertising saying courses are on special for set period of time: this is not true. This just reruns with the clock count down, all of the time. It is designed to make you buy courses. The second is that some instructors will answer question and some just never do. A case in point is an instructor Melanie who runs a course How To Sell Your Art Online With Etsy. After several attempts, I contacted Udemy who had this to say, ""Unfortunately, every once in a while, an instructor will publish a course but not return to the course often, or immediately respond to messages from students. While we encourage instructors to stay engaged with their students, ultimately, we don't have control over responsiveness.""Udemy is a neutral marketplace for instructors and students, which means that instructors are responsible for the content they provide. That is just not good enough. I recommend you try to check the reviews on Udemy before you purchase any course. I paid with PayPal and will take a refund. It is not the money but the rudeness and ""don't give a hand, we have your money"" attitude that infuriates me.

4995,"Original review: Oct. 23, 2017They don't listen to instructors and they will make you feel bad. Alex is the worst person I have come across, he works in the Customer Experience. This guys has zero understanding. I am a seasoned instructor, one of the student started behaving weirdly and use abusive words. I replied to him with smiley and same to you and reported this issue to Udemy policy team. This guys restricted my account and took messaging capabilities and promotion capabilities from me. I tried to tell him multiple times and the fact is he also had access to all the conversation but these people never listen. Specially do not teach on this website. Experience is really bad. Do not waste your time.","Original review: Aug. 27, 2016",2
4996,"Original review: Aug. 27, 2017Initially I was very happy with Udemy, but this changed dramatically after posting my first course. Out of the blue I was asked to ""verify my identity"". This is a very invasive and disturbing request (you enter very detailed private information into an unknown website, much like applying for a loan). I did as requested, but the verification process failed without explanation. Note that I didn't originally agree this validation process. Note also that I was new author with poor sales so the company had little to gain by this process.I went through the alternate verification process (emailing them a video essentially claiming I was who I was) and received no response from Udemy. I asked repeatedly for an explanation and/or instructions, but received no response from Udemy. My course has been banned even though I've followed all the instructions given to me. I feel bullied and confused like I'd just experienced a traumatic mugging. If you're a new instructor, I'd avoid Udemy and consider one of many alternative companies.

4997,"Original review: May 17, 2017The courses are great, however Udemy support is absolutely horrible which seems to be the norm within this industry. Contacted them on several occasions and it takes them over 24 hrs to respond and when they do, they never covers the issue, so it usually takes 3-4 days to resolve even the most simple of problems. I still have not got my issue resolved! They really need to get a grip on support for this company to flourish.","Original review: Aug. 23, 2016",1
4998,"Original review: May 3, 2017I purchased a course yesterday and one today. Both courses in the span of an hour disappeared from my ""Courses"" list. They were there an hour ago. And when reaching out to Udemy support their response time was estimated at 1-2 business days. I don't have time for this.","Original review: Aug. 22, 2016",5
4999,"Original review: April 27, 2017I bought a piano lessons on Udemy, thanks to a youtube advert. The course created seemed to be good, so I'm glad. However, I was surprised to find out there is a problem with playing back the tutorial videos on Udemy, at least for this particular course that I bought (I cannot play back the video lesson 1, whether I changed the browser, clear cookies, etc). I raised the issue to both the course tutors and the technical team. This is what they say.Honestly, I was excited and could not wait to start my piano lessons, and now I realized I had to deal with this?? Not my interest at all. Isn't it supposed to be ready, available, tested, before it is sold to a customer like me??? After few days, I was trying to gather what I should do, they just CLOSED MY REQUEST without checking if I'm okay or not!!!UNACCEPTED CUSTOMER SERVICE! Sold a faulty product (whether their fault, or the course creator's fault, but NOT My fault! I paid, and I Should be able to play the videos, once or twice as I'd like! It's a tutorial website, and that IS THE LEAST thing should be taken into account, right? Being able to play the videos few times so I can practice!!!) and then IGNORED the customer! SUCH A RIP OFF! I will NEVER BUY any course from this place again! Totally unacceptable!

I was watching the Videos on my pace only to realize after a certain point of time that the course has been removed. On asking, they said it happens Once-in-a-while. I loved the course and it's really disappointing. I am not going to buy any of their courses again and I wish I could contest their decision in some court of law.","Original review: Aug. 19, 2016",3
