                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

After searching through their website, while I was signed in, there was no place to cancel before the Trial ended. I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

That's only one part of my experience though. A year and a half later, when I had looked into some further courses but not opted to take one, I got a call from a recruiter about a tech opportunity. I assumed a coding bootcamp I had recently graduated had referred me, but as I reached the end of the interview process and signed their contract, I found out that Coursera had been the source of the recommendation.

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

I went back to try and find out why, and all of their policies state that they don't offer refunds. Everything that looked like a subscription was cancelled through my account notifications, and then I still got billed. There is no customer service available and searching for ""request refund"" takes you to a page where they say they don't offer refunds.As a B Corp, I would expect much better. As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable.

903,"Original review: July 8, 2021Coursera is a rip-off, which I did not realize until a few days into my so called ""7-day Free Trial."" After searching through their website, while I was signed in, there was no place to cancel before the Trial ended. I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

I do web design for a living and I'm not a dumb person, but somehow I couldn't figure out their subscription plans and upgrades and got billed for something. I went back to try and find out why, and all of their policies state that they don't offer refunds. Everything that looked like a subscription was cancelled through my account notifications, and then I still got billed. There is no customer service available and searching for ""request refund"" takes you to a page where they say they don't offer refunds.As a B Corp, I would expect much better. As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later!

Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

1448,"Original review: May 6, 20201. Most of the courses are NOT accredited. Coursera have some accredited courses but they cost around 4k so if you are not paying in thousands then your course is surely not accredited.2. Tutors are non responsive. Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts. Asked for help many times - till now no reply.

I was charged $49.00 for a course I hadn't time to even try (we're in the middle of Coronavirus craziness now). As soon as I received notice of the charges, I tried to contact them via chat, but at this point they aren't even doing ""chats"" anymore. Instead you get routed to a ""help"" page, and once there, you end up in an endless customer non-service do-loop. When you want to cancel the unwanted ""subscription"" (you can't get your money back), it's not straightforward, and neither is cancelling the account. If they were actually offering a good product they wouldn't have to cheat people like this. Buyer beware - you'll pay no matter what, even if they say it's free, and even if you don't want it.

I'm beginning to think it's a scam! Get you interested then PAY if you want to continue.The 2nd was Intro to Web Development. You Waste your time listening to a presenter (who actually wasn't bad) then take the quiz. BUT - you can't upload it unless you PAY $79 to join the class. Literally, it says UPGRADE TO SUBMIT. That's something they don't tell you when you start. Uploading the quiz is the only way to continue so... I just want to get an idea of what is involved in these careers before making a costly mistake. Frustrating and a waste of time. Don't bother.Also, wasn't impressed with the professor (who seems like a very nice guy) for the What is GIS? course.

Think it's just a case of someone who really knows his stuff and assumes everyone else has an idea of what he's talking about.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment.

Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student?

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists!

Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later!

                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you.

That's something they don't tell you when you start. Uploading the quiz is the only way to continue so... I just want to get an idea of what is involved in these careers before making a costly mistake. Frustrating and a waste of time. Don't bother.Also, wasn't impressed with the professor (who seems like a very nice guy) for the What is GIS? course.

Think it's just a case of someone who really knows his stuff and assumes everyone else has an idea of what he's talking about.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades.

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

The problem started when one student started to give me zeros and ones which ruined my grades - even though my work was the same quality as it had been. He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

1668,"Original review: Jan. 5, 2020I'm a verified user on Coursera and have been paying the monthly subscription fee. I've used Coursera for years, since its inception. It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

They keep charging you even after you cancel your subscription to a course. At least that is my experience. When I contact them they resorted to references to ""terms of use"" and ""refund policy"" even after I explain to them that I cancelled the subscription and that on my page it says that I have no current subscriptions.They refunded me for one month as a one-time exception and then when I refused to accept one month, they refunded for additional months. I thought this nightmare ended, but I see now that they continued to charge me. Their customer service team is polite, but their policy is one that based on chicanery.

Coursera's quality seems to have taken a nose-dive. And the company continues to bill you monthly even after you complete a course.

1673,"Original review: Aug. 20, 2019My experience with Coursera wasn't a very pleasant one. First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you.

If you are considering a course through this company, don't do it. There is no way to contact them. There are technical issues with their site. I was not able to complete one module as there was an issue with the quiz. No one at Coursera could give me an answer to allow me to complete the test.

Most brands send you a reminder that you are about to be charged so you can prevent the charge if you want. Not these guys. There is NO option to put the membership on hold or come back and learn on their platform for the months you paid for but didn't use. The membership fee is pretty steep and it is non-refundable.

Coursera have some accredited courses but they cost around 4k so if you are not paying in thousands then your course is surely not accredited.2. Tutors are non responsive. Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts. Asked for help many times - till now no reply.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades.

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment.

So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable.

After searching through their website, while I was signed in, there was no place to cancel before the Trial ended. I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

I went back to try and find out why, and all of their policies state that they don't offer refunds. Everything that looked like a subscription was cancelled through my account notifications, and then I still got billed. There is no customer service available and searching for ""request refund"" takes you to a page where they say they don't offer refunds.As a B Corp, I would expect much better. As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

I went back to try and find out why, and all of their policies state that they don't offer refunds. Everything that looked like a subscription was cancelled through my account notifications, and then I still got billed. There is no customer service available and searching for ""request refund"" takes you to a page where they say they don't offer refunds.As a B Corp, I would expect much better. As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera).

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts. Asked for help many times - till now no reply.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later!

Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you.

I just want to get an idea of what is involved in these careers before making a costly mistake. Frustrating and a waste of time. Don't bother.Also, wasn't impressed with the professor (who seems like a very nice guy) for the What is GIS? course.

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists!

Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing.

The problem started when one student started to give me zeros and ones which ruined my grades - even though my work was the same quality as it had been. He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

2568,"Original review: Jan. 5, 2020I'm a verified user on Coursera and have been paying the monthly subscription fee. I've used Coursera for years, since its inception. It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

They keep charging you even after you cancel your subscription to a course. At least that is my experience. When I contact them they resorted to references to ""terms of use"" and ""refund policy"" even after I explain to them that I cancelled the subscription and that on my page it says that I have no current subscriptions.They refunded me for one month as a one-time exception and then when I refused to accept one month, they refunded for additional months. I thought this nightmare ended, but I see now that they continued to charge me. Their customer service team is polite, but their policy is one that based on chicanery.

Recently though, in 2019, I took two more courses and was very disappointed, both with the quality of the courses, and with the greedy nature of Coursera's billing practices. Coursera's quality seems to have taken a nose-dive. And the company continues to bill you monthly even after you complete a course.

2573,"Original review: Aug. 20, 2019My experience with Coursera wasn't a very pleasant one. First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

2576,"Original review: July 14, 2019It is very sad to see how something great turns into something so close to a scam. I followed Coursera for over a decade. I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.

Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money.

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student?

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment.

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Coursera's quality seems to have taken a nose-dive. And the company continues to bill you monthly even after you complete a course.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

2756,"Original review: July 14, 2019It is very sad to see how something great turns into something so close to a scam. I followed Coursera for over a decade. I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Coursera have some accredited courses but they cost around 4k so if you are not paying in thousands then your course is surely not accredited.2. Tutors are non responsive. Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts. Asked for help many times - till now no reply.

You Waste your time listening to a presenter (who actually wasn't bad) then take the quiz. BUT - you can't upload it unless you PAY $79 to join the class. Literally, it says UPGRADE TO SUBMIT.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you.

However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right.

2869,"Original review: Dec. 15, 2018I enjoy my current experience with Coursera. At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes.

2873,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

2903,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

2979,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project.

I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes.

3023,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

3053,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university.

I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently.

If I enter my payings and subscriptions page, it says that I have never made a payment and I don't have active subscription (which I know, because I had cancelled it, but now I fear they will still charge me for it the next month). Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team!

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

3129,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

3173,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes. You can't beat that! So, to those who love learning, do not hesitate. Sign up for Coursera now and prepare to have a lot of fun. I certainly am!

3203,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes. You can't beat that! So, to those who love learning, do not hesitate. Sign up for Coursera now and prepare to have a lot of fun. I certainly am!

I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do.""

In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare.

But to my surprise, the 29th April they charged me with a month subscription! If I enter my payings and subscriptions page, it says that I have never made a payment and I don't have active subscription (which I know, because I had cancelled it, but now I fear they will still charge me for it the next month). Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team! Considered I can't talk about the course, it seemed interesting but I changed my mind because I wouldn't have time to complete it. However, the customer service seems quite poor and these techniques they also seem to be using with other people seem quite untrustworthy. For those reasons, I wouldn't recommend Coursera to others.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

In my case, I would have started to pay the 29th April, but I unsubscribed the 27th April, double checking that there wasn't any active subscription left (which there wasn't). But to my surprise, the 29th April they charged me with a month subscription! If I enter my payings and subscriptions page, it says that I have never made a payment and I don't have active subscription (which I know, because I had cancelled it, but now I fear they will still charge me for it the next month). Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team! Considered I can't talk about the course, it seemed interesting but I changed my mind because I wouldn't have time to complete it. However, the customer service seems quite poor and these techniques they also seem to be using with other people seem quite untrustworthy. For those reasons, I wouldn't recommend Coursera to others. And I would suggest anyone not to give them their credit card number.

Throughout the 6 weeks of study the teacher made pre-videos to break down information in powerpoints as well as visually trying to draw out what he meant when it came to new vocabulary and understanding. He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

3279,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

                    I decided to try out a trial with Coursera. And the trial, I wasn’t really feeling it. So, I decided to end it. And it was a free trial. Apparently, not. So, I cancelled the subscription. And a couple of months later, I start noticing payments coming out of my account to Coursera. So, I try and reach out to them. There’s no phone number anywhere. There’s no way to speak to somebody at all. They have a chat bubble that’s supposed to populate in the corner, but it doesn’t work with Google browser, with Safari browser, or the app itself. So, I had to try multiple different bowsers to find what the chat bubble would pop up in.

Finally, got to start chatting with somebody, asking them about a refund. They said, “Okay, we’re gonna forward this to some other department, and they’ll be reaching back to you through email.” I’m so glad I cancelled it and I’m not working with them. Because if I ever needed help with anything, it would be insane. They charge high amounts for their services. These are expensive services, and there’s no customer service. It’s unbelievable. So, that’s my review. Don’t waste your time with them. You will regret it. And that’s all.

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

After searching through their website, while I was signed in, there was no place to cancel before the Trial ended. I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

I even googled for directions, then realizing that it did not exist: that is, NO WAY to CANCEL before TRIAL ENDS. I searched further and realized then that there was no contact phone number for them online, and nobody's name listed to contact, plus no address.I finally was able to send a message online via the website while I was signed in, and received an auto-generated message that they would respond. But no one ever responded. They kept sending me marketing type information, and information about their courses, but still no response. The Trial time period ends, and of course they charge my credit card. I immediately contacted my bank to challenge the charge, and after going back and forth with my bank, I was finally given back my funds (from my bank, and not from Coursera). Stay away from Coursera; as one reviewer has noted here on this board also, they will rip you off--by sucking you in with the notion of a Trial period, and then not giving you a place to cancel.

There is no customer service available and searching for ""request refund"" takes you to a page where they say they don't offer refunds.As a B Corp, I would expect much better. As an educational company, I would expect better UX/UI so consumers are not confused about what they are signing up for and have an option to cancel a subscription before being billed for it. You should clearly let consumers know what they are signing up for and what they will be paying for.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

As soon as I received notice of the charges, I tried to contact them via chat, but at this point they aren't even doing ""chats"" anymore. Instead you get routed to a ""help"" page, and once there, you end up in an endless customer non-service do-loop. When you want to cancel the unwanted ""subscription"" (you can't get your money back), it's not straightforward, and neither is cancelling the account. If they were actually offering a good product they wouldn't have to cheat people like this. Buyer beware - you'll pay no matter what, even if they say it's free, and even if you don't want it.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student?

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

That's something they don't tell you when you start. Uploading the quiz is the only way to continue so... I just want to get an idea of what is involved in these careers before making a costly mistake. Frustrating and a waste of time. Don't bother.Also, wasn't impressed with the professor (who seems like a very nice guy) for the What is GIS? course. His explanations were confusing and I had to stop to look up some of the definitions he just went through. Think it's just a case of someone who really knows his stuff and assumes everyone else has an idea of what he's talking about.

He was obviously wanting to sabotage other people's grades. First time I just resubmitted and moved on but 2nd time I reached out to support and, after forcing them to take a look they responded that ""due to the privacy settings your peers selected on their accounts we're unable to identify which out of the 3 peers that reviewed your assignment provided you a bad score. Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student? It seems they are asking me to do their job for them. Of course I have had to resubmit but now my assignment is late and isn't getting reviews. And, of course, I have to pay by time to continue with this course. This is a BIG disappointment and totally ruins Coursera for me.

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4.

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later!

                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

If they were actually offering a good product they wouldn't have to cheat people like this. Buyer beware - you'll pay no matter what, even if they say it's free, and even if you don't want it.

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student?

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

Unfortunately, unless you have more detailed information about the peer that provided you a bad score, we won't be able to further investigate.""How can I ID the other student?

It was not bad at first, pretty good really. But, the changes implemented to the platform over 2018/2019 are turning it into a profit driven scam machine. A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you. As to the quality of the platform, the interface for the platform has become more streamlined, while the content has become more watered down. Ultimately, Coursera's changes are legitimizing critics of MOOCs who said these platforms would prove unreliable, untrustworthy, and worthless.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"".

The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

When I contact them they resorted to references to ""terms of use"" and ""refund policy"" even after I explain to them that I cancelled the subscription and that on my page it says that I have no current subscriptions.They refunded me for one month as a one-time exception and then when I refused to accept one month, they refunded for additional months.

First of all, after the 7-day trial period (in order to obtain which you need to provide your card or PayPal info) they take the money without any warning. So I would recommend anybody who wants to try, to give your PayPal account and then immediately delete the automatic payment option in PayPal (that is formed automatically also, by the way), otherwise on the 7th day without you knowing it, Coursera will charge you. Well, they charged me and I was ok with it, thinking that I will do the 4-month course, but after finishing 3 weeks of the 1st course, it got inactive despite the fact that I still had 2 more weeks to finish the last assignment. And it happened just like that, without any notifications, nada!I tried to contact the Support Team, but they are uncontactable, when you go to the support page, where allegedly you can write a message to them, the system shows an error message - Ooops, this page no longer exists! So, according to their greedy logic, in order to be enrolled to the course again, I again need to take part one, I again need to pay for the part one and I again need to spend my time doing the same tasks. Wonderful. Coursera is really a stealing genius. This is the course they need to have - ""How quickly and painlessly take money from the fools that want to learn something"". Must add also that info on their new courses they send out punctually. This you always get opposed to the payment notifications.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4.

I used both free (when they were still free) and paid options. My latest experience feels like a total scam. I subscribed for a specialization that I was willing to pay the monthly subscription cost. The first week was the elementary material for someone from like myself, who works in the industry. However, the course author (IBM) and the syllabus looked very promising. First week's assignment was to submit an empty text file (a bit weird, right?). Other weeks require programming assignment submissions in the form of a Python program file.Here is what the most interesting part starts: After your first week you paid the subscription, that I was totally ok with (I was committed to completing the specialization, as I did more than once in the past). However, the 2nd and 3rd-week assignments were graded at 0 points, and very general feedback provided suggesting check the forum. On the forum, I suddenly found several people facing the same issue without any support from the course author or Coursera. The non-refund policy for a course with trial got me mad. I can't complete the course, and I already paid for it and can't get my money back. All of this doesn't feel very right. I don't mind paying for the quality product (under specific circumstance for any quality product), but in this case, I got nothing. Regardless of how the refund request goes, it creates a very unpleasant experience. At this point, I would recommend staying away, and I can't believe I am the one saying it. So sad.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later! Recently I'm in a situation that I see other students reporting the same issue as me, I keep asking for help every day on the same issue and have been ignored for weeks.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

Sometimes they do answer but since you are paying monthly subscription, it seem in they interest not to answer your questions so that you keep paying for longer. Seen posts from a year ago that have their only response a year later!

                            3. Tutorials are outdated for years! Coursera wants to use programs that is specific for them (like IBM cloud) but the tutorials are few years old and the interface has changed since then. So when they guide you ""click here"" there is no such an option any more. When you're stuck, you will need to manually search from tons of students who had the same problem or find a friend who will help you as your chances of getting response from tutors are slim.4. Don't count on in depth explanations. A lot of material is covered fast so I was glad I have done my python course beforehand and that I have masters degree in Math - otherwise I think I would be lost. Finally: My ""Data Science professional certificate course"" consists of 9 sub-courses. Due to some technical problem I can't finish 1 sub - part and since there is no answer from tutors it seem like all the other certificates I got will come to waste as I can't finish the course without submitting all the parts.

A couple of months ago they sent me a classic bait and switch survey email that is common to Craigslist scams; you answer some questions to see if you ""qualify"" to take the survey for some reward, but the questions you're answering ARE the survey.And then, a couple days ago Coursera puts up a stonewall front page to their site with new ""privacy"" terms whereby you can either agree to allow them to sell your info to third parties, or you can delete your account completely losing all work that you've paid for in time and money. It's extortion. They're holding your work and records for ransom until you pay through personal exploitation. Their customer service exists, and eventually may respond by email, but it's slow and curt if they ever get back to you.

At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes.

4373,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes. You can't beat that! So, to those who love learning, do not hesitate. Sign up for Coursera now and prepare to have a lot of fun. I certainly am!

The frustrating problem is that there is no phone support or email support. I have tried using the Chat feature, but nothing happens.

4403,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response.

The company addressed my problem and issued a refund for the month in question.Original review: Oct. 13, 2018I had great expectations for this service, as it was recommended by a college advisor from Stanford as well as from the company I work for. However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team!

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

Throughout the 6 weeks of study the teacher made pre-videos to break down information in powerpoints as well as visually trying to draw out what he meant when it came to new vocabulary and understanding. He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study. I think all the classes just depend on the teacher because the one I joined has an agenda and all tests were a review of what we’d done.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

4479,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes.

4493,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

Considered I can't talk about the course, it seemed interesting but I changed my mind because I wouldn't have time to complete it. However, the customer service seems quite poor and these techniques they also seem to be using with other people seem quite untrustworthy. For those reasons, I wouldn't recommend Coursera to others. And I would suggest anyone not to give them their credit card number.

4503,"Original review: April 26, 2019I was fortunate enough to get a good teacher who valued that each person learned different and gave the one on one communication that was necessary. Throughout the 6 weeks of study the teacher made pre-videos to break down information in powerpoints as well as visually trying to draw out what he meant when it came to new vocabulary and understanding. He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study. I think all the classes just depend on the teacher because the one I joined has an agenda and all tests were a review of what we’d done.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

4523,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes. You can't beat that! So, to those who love learning, do not hesitate. Sign up for Coursera now and prepare to have a lot of fun. I certainly am!

4553,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do.""

In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team!

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

4652,"Original review: May 3, 2019I was interested in a Coursera course and, for trying it, I gave them my credit card information. They offer you 7 days for free, and if you unsubscribe, they won't charge you for it. In my case, I would have started to pay the 29th April, but I unsubscribed the 27th April, double checking that there wasn't any active subscription left (which there wasn't). But to my surprise, the 29th April they charged me with a month subscription! If I enter my payings and subscriptions page, it says that I have never made a payment and I don't have active subscription (which I know, because I had cancelled it, but now I fear they will still charge me for it the next month). Now I am trying to ask for a refund, but I doubt I will get it. It's already been hard to find a place where I could send a message to the support team! Considered I can't talk about the course, it seemed interesting but I changed my mind because I wouldn't have time to complete it. However, the customer service seems quite poor and these techniques they also seem to be using with other people seem quite untrustworthy. For those reasons, I wouldn't recommend Coursera to others. And I would suggest anyone not to give them their credit card number.

Throughout the 6 weeks of study the teacher made pre-videos to break down information in powerpoints as well as visually trying to draw out what he meant when it came to new vocabulary and understanding. He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

4659,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it.

4673,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

4689,"Original review: March 9, 2019I'm delighted to have this course offered on Positive Psychology through Coursera. I found out about it through the Friday Center at UNC. The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

4699,"Original review: Dec. 15, 2018I enjoy my current experience with Coursera. At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

I have been using Coursera more or less since it first started and I have watched as it's matured into one of the best MOOC sites on the Web. There are a variety of topics where one can learn what he or she is interested in, including computer science, cybersecurity, data science, writing, history, math, video game development, and on and on. Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required. Virtually every class can be audited, so there is no reason to pay unless the student chooses to. I love the site and I will continue loving it. I have an enormous backlog of classes to work through right now and it's only going to get bigger as more and more schools sign up for the platform to give all of us FREE college education right from the comfort of our homes. You can't beat that! So, to those who love learning, do not hesitate. Sign up for Coursera now and prepare to have a lot of fun. I certainly am!

4703,"Original review: Oct. 24, 2018I want to first point out that I graduated in 2016 from UB with my BSBA. UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes.

Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

4729,"Original review: Dec. 15, 2018I enjoy my current experience with Coursera. At the moment I am taking two courses, both in the Marketing sector (Digital Mkt by University of Illinois and Neuromarketing by Copenhagen Business School). I find the videos interesting and the assignments as well. I learned many interesting things in these couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to check also the other course materials. Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

Best of all: it's free! Yes, if a person wants a credential to put on his or her resume or LinkedIn profile, then he or she can pay a fair monthly fee, but it's not required.

UB is an AACSB accredited business institution and a world renowned R1 research university. My concentration is MIS, so to continue to build on my technical know-how, I decided to enroll in the very first blockchain specialization offered by UB through the Coursera platform. I enrolled in a monthly subscription for $39 in August. On 10/7 I received an email stating that there was ""an issue processing your payment."" I had already taken tests and started the project so I hurried to update my payment information. I waited and waited but the money never came out and I never regained access. I attempted to just reenroll, simple, right? Well instead of the $39 I signed up for, they wanted $49 to enroll again. I have a billing statement for $39 dated 10/7 and another requesting me to update my payment method and pay $39 by 10/12. I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently. I will reach out to Channel 2 to see if they would like to pick up a story on holding people in power accountable...

However, after putting in many hours of work, completing all of the quizzes and reading materials, I was unable to pass the course at the end of the 5 weeks due to a flaw in the peer-review grading system. Any peer can fail your final project without reason and without recourse, as there are no human phone support specialists. If you have failed your final project, you must re-submit. In the meantime, Coursera will bill you for an additional month while you wait for students in the next round of classes to review your assignment. It is definitely possible that no one will review your assignment, and you will be billed every month until you decide it is no longer worth the money to continue gambling that someone will pass your final project. I am sorely disappointed in this service and feel they mislead their customers on the cost of a certificate. The cost is theoretically unbounded, as this cycle could continue forever.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera.

I contacted Coursera twice, the first time on 10/19 after I got tired of waiting to see the changes I made to my payment information be updated. I was told course rates ""fluctuate"" which is not an answer good enough to pacify me. The final time I contacted them they told me that they ""had a system error that prevented my payment from going through"" and there is ""nothing they could do."" But I can ""enroll at $49 to regain full access."" In other words, they sent me statements to pay $39 on 10/7 and 10/12 but when I contacted them on 10/19 I was told that I have to pay $49 now to get back all of the work I did. First, a platform hosting as notable names as Coursera has should NOT be creating bad business, I wonder if these institutions know what they are doing (probably not but I am working on that). In any case why should this platform use my alma mater's name yet provide horrible resolution by doing nothing at all. Second, let's not pretend that we aren't using this platform to save money. It seems that the only people not fine with losing money are those who do not have it to spare. That is exploitation, or taking advantage of those who are underprivileged, and I am sure many others would agree. Unfortunately, it is legal but people make it acceptable when they choose to sit silently.

He was great. Not only did we have access to him in an E-mail but also the other students in the classes for somewhat of an online group study.

What I found within the first week of taking the course was the quizzes were not completely based on the material provided. The video lectures, required reading, and optional reading assignments did not provide you with the information to pass the quizzes. Also, there were no hints or suggestions as to how to or where to find the information. By week 2 the quiz was completely on information that was not provided. I have my degree in electrical engineering and know how to study and find information, but it makes no sense to me why the course materials are not represented by the quizzes. That is how it worked in college - you read a chapter, the professor lectures on the topic, you do homework on the topic, then you take a quiz or test on the information you learned. Not so with this course, you learn one thing but are asked questions on material you have no knowledge about.

The professor, Barbara Fredrickson, is renowned in this field and she teaches PP at the University of North Carolina, near me. I appreciate the format and set up of the course. The videos are very well done. Barbara has 3 other people with her, all employees of UNC, who take the course and we get to view and hear their interaction. I'm extremely interested in Positive Psychology and you won't find a better professor than Fredrickson. A helpful aspect is that you can save notes, repeat parts of the vids, and you have written text to follow if you like along with the vid. A big drawback is LACK OF SUPPORT. For being an educational program, this is a huge disadvantage!!! No toll free number. I emailed a question 4 days ago and never got a response. Also, I have no way of contacting other people taking the course right now. Like a chat room situation. For an educational company, I'm really surprised at the lack of support with Coursera. I'm very pleased with Barbara's course here. It's pleasant to watch and learn this way, I just miss having others to interact with.

Also, great customer service on the chat!In response to Mr. ** of Riyadh's observation, I dare to say that this is not a movies platform, but an OPTIONAL educational platform. I understand and support the idea that each state has to provide a free educational system for its citizens, but when it comes about OPTIONAL programs supported by a global BUSINESS, you must pay. Because yes, Coursera is a BUSINESS, and it needs to generate profit. It's not the same as your state's government which has an obligation towards you, its citizen, but a COMPANY providing good quality study materials at a cost. You have the option of a 7 days free trial in which you can read exactly the materials you're interested in and take a decision.When it comes about Netflix, you're spending $8*12 months = $96 to watch a limited number of series, documentaries and movies. Nothing bad, because this is exactly how much this entertainment service should charge. It is an opportunity for leisure at a fair price. BUT IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT! On the other hand, a $79 membership on any trustworthy educational platform (that would be $948 per year), it is an investment. Investment = the action or process of investing money for profit. You're investing money into a program so you can get the knowledge that would generate profit. Profit means also that you can build a successful business for yourself or you can become a more skillful employee that generates more revenue for the company, and as a result, earns more money. And trust me, once you start earning more, you'll cover the amount you spent in a matter of months! So yes, knowledge requires sacrifices, and sometimes you need to give up your Netflix membership or the beers at the bar. I hope I helped.

While some content was informative, the professor was frequently dropping his own name about his research and it was quite distracting.

I really appreciated the Supply Chain Professors' going out to real world facilities and teaching from there: diapers.com, warbyparker.com, etc. And the Finance and Accounting Courses were great as well, with valuable spreadsheets and debit and credit football helmets. J. Payment was wonderful, I understood an upfront lump sum and paid it for each course... the best part was my carbon footprint was minimized and I never had to drive anywhere to get it all done. The content was as good or better than many of my MBA courses. I got the idea from NPR Marketplace's piece on MBA for $2K. I was very happy.My experience with Ecole Polytechnique was the only disappointment, when I completed all the work and even did extra grading for them, but they never gave me credit, just said I had to re-submit my work again in the next session. So... I signed up for the current session... let's hope this goes okay. I was also very thankful when I talked to a woman staffer at Coursera. When I explained to her my frustration about a change in the Wharton curriculum requirements that occurred during my completion effort and also explained the Ecole problem, she was willing to help me with the necessary changes. So now it is up to me to try and fit in with Ecole's schedule and call my credit card company when I am done to make sure no further charges are coming from Coursera.I just wanted to again thank all the people working so diligently to prepare great courses on Coursera and deliver MOOC's to students worldwide. I am sorry to hear some others have lost their money in ways they found disappointing, however I hope that Coursera will help them soon so that this much appreciated way to learn is sustainable.

I would not get a refund. In addition, I felt the course content (Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence) was very disappointing. While some content was informative, the professor was frequently dropping his own name about his research and it was quite distracting. I also felt the assignments were appropriate for someone training to be a psychologist, learning to code scripts of conversation, will not help me in my business application.

I didn't get an email, I got a notification within the application confirming the cancellation. Since I didn't have the email, she said they wouldn't issue a refund. After indicating my unhappiness, the support person said she would cancel my subscription and that she would have to ""escalate"" my issue and I would hear from support service.

A few months later I noticed 3 charges of $49 on my card - they had me signed up to a subscription! I never had any intention of doing this and I'm pretty savvy to be careful of 'online subscriptions.' Completely deceptive and judging from other customers I wasn't the only one.

I really appreciated the Supply Chain Professors' going out to real world facilities and teaching from there: diapers.com, warbyparker.com, etc. And the Finance and Accounting Courses were great as well, with valuable spreadsheets and debit and credit football helmets. J. Payment was wonderful, I understood an upfront lump sum and paid it for each course... the best part was my carbon footprint was minimized and I never had to drive anywhere to get it all done. The content was as good or better than many of my MBA courses. I got the idea from NPR Marketplace's piece on MBA for $2K. I was very happy.My experience with Ecole Polytechnique was the only disappointment, when I completed all the work and even did extra grading for them, but they never gave me credit, just said I had to re-submit my work again in the next session. So... I signed up for the current session... let's hope this goes okay. I was also very thankful when I talked to a woman staffer at Coursera. When I explained to her my frustration about a change in the Wharton curriculum requirements that occurred during my completion effort and also explained the Ecole problem, she was willing to help me with the necessary changes. So now it is up to me to try and fit in with Ecole's schedule and call my credit card company when I am done to make sure no further charges are coming from Coursera.I just wanted to again thank all the people working so diligently to prepare great courses on Coursera and deliver MOOC's to students worldwide. I am sorry to hear some others have lost their money in ways they found disappointing, however I hope that Coursera will help them soon so that this much appreciated way to learn is sustainable.

I don't anticipate a good outcome which is a shame because I liked the course but couldn't continue. Now I won't return to it.

I am pleased with the result and have had my faith in the online course program restored. I hope others who have duped by that process find resolution. Grateful.Original review: Dec. 6, 2017Very disappointing: The course I signed in for was one thing, but the cost to me financially makes me feel like I been duped. There is no customer service to help process anything - everything about the finances seems automated. I have been charged for three months now (approximately $60 per month) for a service I cancelled at the outset. Shame on Coursera for exploiting the online process. I will have to contact my bank in order to cut off their payments. When I checked my purchases page on December 5 for a fee they charged me for on December 4th, I was already getting a ""Refund Deadline Has Passed"". Their policy on refunds states that they will refund within a two week period.","Original review: Dec. 19, 2017",3

When I tried to un-enroll and be reimbursed, the website proved to make this impossible, with not even a way to contact the company to obtain reimbursement. I sent them an email to their security address (the one I could find), joking that this must have been a hack that made the reimbursement process impossible. Of course I was never reimbursed.","Original review: Dec. 8, 2017",1

It's nearly impossible to cancel once enrolled and nearly impossible to find a person to help you once you're enrolled. India cannot pay through debit cards, and can't use Amex (with strong dispute handling). It's ""easy to get into - impossible to cancel even if you want to"" model is well known for online scams - but is a shame for an academic platform.

But at March, 2017 I realized that my account was charged every month! I realized, that I signed up for the specialization, not for a class!

I haven't received any email from them about charges while they send email every day to offer me other courses. I tried to contact them but there is no contact number and they guide you to a page which basically says no Refund, I expect this nasty method of making money from a cosmetic seller but not from the academic purpose company, I'm so sorry to see this unprofessional strategy targeting students!

I had no idea that the course materials would be a few slideshows and the projects would mostly test my googling skills. After finishing the 3rd course in the series, I wanted out, but the refund period had already expired.

4980,"Original review: June 3, 2018Please be very careful when you pick a particular course from a specialization. I picked the Customer Analytics course and didn't interest the other courses in the specialization, so they continued to charge me after finishing Customer Analytics, and didn't give my money back, so I paid around $240 for only one course which worths only $79. You are not fair Coursera, and your managers should take some courses about business ethics.

4981,"Original review: May 24, 2018I am sorry to hear so many people felt frustrated. My experience completing the Wharton Business Specialization was excellent. I really appreciated Barbara ** for Marketing with her 4P's and axes of excellence. I really appreciated the Supply Chain Professors' going out to real world facilities and teaching from there: diapers.com, warbyparker.com, etc. And the Finance and Accounting Courses were great as well, with valuable spreadsheets and debit and credit football helmets. J. Payment was wonderful, I understood an upfront lump sum and paid it for each course... the best part was my carbon footprint was minimized and I never had to drive anywhere to get it all done. The content was as good or better than many of my MBA courses. I got the idea from NPR Marketplace's piece on MBA for $2K. I was very happy.My experience with Ecole Polytechnique was the only disappointment, when I completed all the work and even did extra grading for them, but they never gave me credit, just said I had to re-submit my work again in the next session. So... I signed up for the current session... let's hope this goes okay. I was also very thankful when I talked to a woman staffer at Coursera. When I explained to her my frustration about a change in the Wharton curriculum requirements that occurred during my completion effort and also explained the Ecole problem, she was willing to help me with the necessary changes. So now it is up to me to try and fit in with Ecole's schedule and call my credit card company when I am done to make sure no further charges are coming from Coursera.I just wanted to again thank all the people working so diligently to prepare great courses on Coursera and deliver MOOC's to students worldwide. I am sorry to hear some others have lost their money in ways they found disappointing, however I hope that Coursera will help them soon so that this much appreciated way to learn is sustainable.

I had no idea that I was part of a subscription. I couldn't call or contact anyone at Coursera. So... No accountability on their part. They must be paying off other businesses because no one is holding Coursera accountable as they rob people blind. So this is legal, to tell people that a course is free or one set fee, then, discreetly and subtly throw in a subscription and to make it extremely difficult to cancel, and impossible to refund.

I had received an email that this would happen a couple days before the credit card was charged, but I couldn't get online in time to stop it. Of course, my credit card was charged last night. As in my first screenshot, you see the message in my email that I would be charged on the next day. In the second screenshot, you can see I was officially charged March 24th, which is today. My main complaint is that not even a single day has passed since my credit card was charged again and I can't get a refund??? The subscription is useless to me...

Called the number and was told I could email at payments@coursera.org or look in course support pages. I emailed and did get a very quick response but got the same exact answer as Jennifer. I would not get a refund. In addition, I felt the course content (Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence) was very disappointing. While some content was informative, the professor was frequently dropping his own name about his research and it was quite distracting. I also felt the assignments were appropriate for someone training to be a psychologist, learning to code scripts of conversation, will not help me in my business application.
